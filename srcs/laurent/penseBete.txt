execute CGI based on certain file extension (for example .php)
· You wonder what a CGI is go? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface
· Because you wont call the cgi directly use the full path as PATH_INFO
· Just remember that for chunked request, your server need to unchunked it and the CGI will expect EOF as end of the body.
· Same things for the output of the CGI. if no content_length is returned
from the CGI, EOF will mean the end of the returned data.
· Your program should set the following Meta-Variables
AUTH_TYPE
CONTENT_LENGTH
CONTENT_TYPE
GATEWAY_INTERFACE
PATH_INFO*
PATH_TRANSLATED
QUERY_STRING*
REMOTE_ADDR
REMOTE_IDENT
REMOTE_USER
REQUEST_METHOD
REQUEST_URI
SCRIPT_NAME*
SERVER_NAME
SERVER_PORT
SERVER_PROTOCOL
SERVER_SOFTWARE


· Your program should call the cgi with the file requested as first argument
· the cgi should be run in the correct directory for relativ path file access
· your server should work with php-cgi


pas demande  : REMOTE_HOST ????
-----------------------------------
The server acts as an application gateway.  It receives the request
   from the client, selects a CGI script to handle the request, converts
   the client request to a CGI request, executes the script and converts
   the CGI response into a response for the client.  When processing the
   client request, it is responsible for implementing any protocol or
   transport level authentication and security. 
------------------------------------
script-URI = <scheme> "://" <server-name> ":" <server-port>
                   <script-path> <extra-path> "?" <query-string>

   where <scheme> is found from SERVER_PROTOCOL, <server-name>,
   <server-port> and <query-string> are the values of the respective
   meta-variables.  The SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO values, URL-encoded
   with ";", "=" and "?"  reserved, give <script-path> and <extra-path>.
